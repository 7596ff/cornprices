###making this work with wheat prices

idk you gotta change the domain to wheatprices and double check that the information is coming from the same place on the wheat prices and then get yourself a twitter app with read write and DM privilges and create an api key and the application keys and all this oauth bullshit then you gotta push the app to appsot by importing it from the yaml file make sure you change it to be the url of the app then you can fucking tweet wheat prices but fuck that corn prices is where it's at man idk why you gotta cramp my style
